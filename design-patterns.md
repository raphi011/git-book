## Principles

### KISS

Keep it simple, stupid. Simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

### SOLID

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)

An acronym for five design principles in object-oriented programming that is intended to make software more understandable, flexible and maintainable.

**Single-responsibility principle**

A class should only have a single responsibility.

**Open-closed principle**

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**Liskov substituion principle**

Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.

**Interface segregation principle**

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

**Dependency inversion principle**

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

### DRY

Don't repeat yourself - when applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements.
