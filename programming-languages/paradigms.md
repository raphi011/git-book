# Paradigms

## Object oriented programming

### Inheritance

Inheritance establishes an “_is-a_” relationship between the classes.

Overridden methods should preserve the substitutability promoted by the Liskov Substitution Principle.

### Polymorphism

### Abstraction

### Encapsulation

#### Shy class

Shy classes do not reveal unnecessary implementation details about itself or others.
